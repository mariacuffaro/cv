# Maria Cuffaro

Experienced software developer with 20 years experience, always looking to update my skillset and try something new.  In the past I have developed Mainframe and Oracle Applications and have spent the last two years as a Robotic Process Automation Developer.  

After graduating from City University with a degree in Maths, I joined the John Lewis Partnership’s (JLP) Graduate IT scheme as a Trainee Programmer.  I have enjoyed a varied career, working on many exciting projects and developing using a variety of languages and technologies.  

I am now looking forward to completing the 16 week bootcamp at the Makers Acadamy which is the springboard to my next chapter as a full stack Web Developer working in a John Lewis Online team.


# Skills

  * Coaching others - I currently volunteer at a school lunchtime club called Computer Club for Girls (CC4G) which I find very rewarding, we help the girls to create thier own website using html and css
  * Development - To date, I have completed projects using Ruby, HTML, CSS, Java, Unix, Blue Prism (I am a Certified Developer), C#, Oracle (PL/sql, Application Development Framework (ADF), Oracle Application Framework(OAF)) and Kotlin
  * Analysis - I have worked on many full lifecycle projects and have worked on all aspects of the development lifecycle
  * Testing - Experienced with Unit testing, System Testing, Acceptance Testing and the various tools used to record and run those tests (eg Jira, Quality Centre).  I have limited experience of TDD and have used JUnit (to test Java and Kotlin code), RSpec (for Ruby code)
  * Stakeholder Management - Part of my role has always involved working with stakeholders to achieve the outcome they require. During my most recent project (to develop a robotic process to read, match and pay supplier invoices) I needed to engage with stakeholders within IT, Finance and the Call Centre to deliver a successful solution

# Experience

## JLP RPA Developer (Jul '17 - Present)
Before joining Makers Acadamy I worked in a DevOps team, developing Robotic Process Automations using a leading RPA software (Blue Prism).  This role involved some line management, coaching new team members, release management and setting up team processes that have enabled us to move from PoC to a fully scaled enterprise solution.

## JLP Systems Developer (Sep ’98 – Oct ‘04)
During this time I was on a structured graduate program which involved rapid progression from Trainee, to Programmer, Senior Programmer and eventually Principal Programmer.

One example from this period is an in-house web based Ticketing System that I designed and built (with a DB2 database, CICs Cobal back-end and Java, CSS, html front-end)
