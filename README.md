# Maria Cuffaro

Experienced software developer with 20 years experience, always looking to update my skillset and try something new.  In the past I have developed Mainframe and Oracle Applications and have spent the last two years as a Robotic Process Automation Developer.  

After graduating from City University with a degree in Maths, I joined the John Lewis Partnership’s (JLP) Graduate IT scheme as a Trainee Programmer.  I have enjoyed a varied career, working on many exciting projects and developing using a variety of languages and technologies.  

I am now looking forward to completing the 16 week bootcamp at the Makers Academy which is the springboard to my next chapter as a full stack Web Developer working in a John Lewis Online team.

# Skills

  * Coaching others - I currently volunteer at a school lunchtime club called Computer Club for Girls (CC4G) which I find very rewarding, we help the girls to create their own website using html and css
  * Development - To date, I have completed projects using Ruby, HTML, CSS, Java, Unix, Blue Prism (I am a Certified Developer), C#, Oracle (PL/sql, Application Development Framework (ADF), Oracle Application Framework(OAF)) and Kotlin
  * Analysis - I have worked on many full lifecycle projects and have worked on all aspects of the development lifecycle
  * Testing - Experienced with Unit testing, System Testing, Acceptance Testing and the various tools used to record and run those tests (e.g. Jira, Quality Centre).  I have limited experience of TDD and have used JUnit (to test Java and Kotlin code) and RSpec (for Ruby code)
  * Stakeholder Management - Part of my role has always involved working with stakeholders to achieve the outcome they require. During my most recent project (developing a robotic process to read, match and pay supplier invoices) I needed to engage with stakeholders within IT, Finance and the Call Centre Processes to deliver a successful solution

# Experience

## JLP RPA Developer (Jul '17 - Present)
Before joining Makers Academy I worked in a DevOps team, developing Robotic Process Automations using leading RPA software (Blue Prism).  This role involved Agile ways of working, some line management, coaching new team members, release management and setting up team processes that have enabled us to move from Proof of Concept to a fully scaled enterprise solution.

## JLP Oracle Developer (Oct '04 – July ‘17).
During this time I was involved in two major transformation programs and had various roles including:-
  * Technical Lead responsible for development of PartnerLink (Our name for Oracle HRMS) and managing 3rd Party offshore resources 
  * Lead Partner Developer for Front End (Oracle web technologies OAF and OAF), involved in delivering screen customisations as part of a large program to roll out full PartnerLink self-service
  * Lead developer of all things OTL (Oracle Time and Labour)
  * Lead developer responsible for writing code to migrate work patterns and rotas from DB2 Tables to Oracle HRMS tables

## JLP Systems Developer (Sep ’98 – Oct ‘04)
During this time I was on a structured graduate program which involved rapid progression from Trainee, to Programmer, Senior Programmer and eventually Principal Programmer.  I worked on various Projects using mainframe technologies (CICs, Cobol, DB2), as well as some Java, HTML and CSS.  One example from this period is an in-house web based Ticketing System that I designed and built (with a DB2 database, CICs Cobol back-end and Java, CSS, html front-end)

# Hobbies and Interests
  *	Walking: I live near to Epping Forest and enjoy a lovely walk in the trees each morning with my family and our lovely dog.
  *	Reading: I am a member of a book club; I love fiction, non-fiction, classics, modern, and all books really.
  *	Going to the Theatre: I try to go at least a couple of times a year to see a mix of serious plays and less serious but just as enjoyable musicals.
  *	WellBeing: I am a Wellbeing Champion at work and am interested in the benefits of meditation (which I practice regularly) as well as the science behind healthy eating and good sleep patterns 
  *	Active holidays: I find it quite hard to sit still so I love to go skiing or, if I am on a summer holiday, do lots of walking, cycling and sightseeing
