I am an experienced developer with 20 years experience and always looking to update my skillset and try something new.  In the past I have developed Mainframe and Oracle Applications and I have spent the last two years as a Robotic Process Automation Developer.

After graduating from City University with a degree in Maths, I joined the John Lewis Partnership’s Graduate IT scheme as a Trainee Programmer.  I have enjoyed a varied career, working on many exciting projects and developing using a variety of languages and technologies.
