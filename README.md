# Maria Cuffaro

I am an experienced software developer with 20 years experience and am always looking to update my skillset and try something new.  In the past I have developed Mainframe and Oracle Applications and I have spent the last two years as a Robotic Process Automation Developer.  

I am now looking forward to completing the 16 week bootcamp at the Makers Acadamy which is the springboard to my next chapter as a full stack Web Developer and moving to one of the John Lewis Online teams.

After graduating from City University with a degree in Maths, I joined the John Lewis Partnership’s (JLP) Graduate IT scheme as a Trainee Programmer.  I have enjoyed a varied career, working on many exciting projects and developing using a variety of languages and technologies.
